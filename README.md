# SuperResolution
 image super-resolution is to increase the resolution of a single image. The output is a higher-resolution image that is sharp, clear and natural. <br>
  
The original image, after resized to 1/3 of its original size, loses details. <br>
Built-in low-resolution image using ‘Bicubic’ interpolation up-samples a blurry output still with no many details. <br>
If we use a CNN-based method SRCNN to do super-resolution, output will contain sharper and clearer edges.  <br>
